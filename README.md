# ETF vs Traditional Banking Investment Analysis (2006–2026)

## Overview

This project presents a structured financial analysis comparing long-term investment performance between:

- VTI (Total U.S. Market ETF)
- SMH (Semiconductor Sector ETF)
- U.S. Bank Certificates of Deposit (CDs)

The study evaluates which strategy delivers stronger long-term capital growth using historical annual returns from 2006 to 2026.

## Core Question

If $10,000 had been invested in 2006, how would each strategy have performed over 20 years?

This project analyzes:

- Annual returns
- Compound growth
- Volatility exposure
- Performance leadership by year
- Best and worst performing years
- Cumulative capital appreciation

---

## Analytical Approach

The project combines:

- Excel-based financial modeling and data visualization
- SQL relational database design and advanced querying (Supabase)

In Excel, financial data was structured, modeled, and visualized using charts and comparison tools to enable rapid performance analysis and trend identification.

In SQL, structured queries were implemented to automate capital growth calculations, identify annual winners, and rank best/worst performing years using window functions and conditional logic.

## Use of Artificial Intelligence Tools

This project was developed with the support of multiple AI tools used as productivity and research assistants.

AI was leveraged to:

- Accelerate query structuring
- Validate financial modeling logic
- Refine database design
- Improve documentation clarity

All financial modeling, database architecture, analytical logic, and validation were designed, structured, and verified independently. AI tools were used as support resources to enhance efficiency and workflow speed — not as substitutes for analytical decision-making.
