# ETF vs Traditional Banking Investment Analysis (2006–2026)

## Overview

This project presents a structured financial analysis comparing long-term investment performance between:

- VTI (Total U.S. Market ETF)

## Core Question

If $10,000 had been invested in 2006, how would each strategy have performed over 21 years?

This project analyzes:

- Annual returns
- Compound growth
- Volatility exposure
- Performance leadership by year
- Best and worst performing years
- Cumulative capital appreciation

---

## Analytical Approach

The project combines:

- Excel-based financial modeling and visual analysis
- SQL relational database design and advanced querying (Supabase)

In Excel, financial data was structured, modeled, and visualized using charts and dynamic visual tools to allow quick performance comparison and trend identification.

In SQL, structured queries were implemented to automate calculations such as capital growth, ranking, and annual performance comparison.
