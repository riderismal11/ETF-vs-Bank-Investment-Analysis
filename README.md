# ETF vs Traditional Banking Investment Analysis (2006–2026)

## Overview

This project presents a structured financial analysis comparing long-term investment performance between:

- VTI (Total U.S. Market ETF)
- SMH (Semiconductor Sector ETF)
- U.S. Bank Certificates of Deposit (CDs)

The study evaluates which strategy delivers stronger long-term capital growth using historical annual returns from 2006 to 2026.

## Core Question

If $10,000 had been invested in 2006, how would each strategy have performed over 21 years?

This project analyzes:

- Annual returns
- Compound growth
- Volatility exposure
- Performance leadership by year
- Best and worst performing years
- Cumulative capital appreciation

## Example Result (Investment Simulation)

Using structured financial modeling:

- $10,000 invested in VTI
- $10,000 invested in SMH
- $10,000 invested in CDs (3.92% average rate)

Each investment is tracked year-by-year to evaluate total capital growth and cumulative gains.
